Preparedness
The need for senior officer command staff became evident as the winds increased and the fire spread. The Lahaina
District captain remained on shift throughout the night to ensure personnel were directed and supported taking on
additional rescue operations as the fire moved through Lahaina. Emergency call backs of off-duty personnel began
as early as 10:00 a.m. on August 8, 2023, and by 3:00 p.m. pre-shift call backs were initiated of officers that had
worked the night prior and into the mid-morning of August 8.
Beginning as early as 1:25 p.m., the Lahaina District captain activated a field command post, manned by civilian
personnel as well as supervisory and senior officers, in response to the severe weather and subsequent events to
that point. The Lahaina District captain remained as the incident commander, continuing duties from the field.
An MPD liaison was assigned to the County of Maui Emergency Operations Center (EOC) 24 hours a day, seven days
a week beginning on August 8, 2023 at approximately 4:45 a.m. Additionally, late on the evening of August 8, 2023,
preparations began for round the clock staffing of the Maui Police Department Operations Center (DOC). The DOC
continued under this staffing through September. Lahaina District had 12-hour staffing beyond October.
First Responder Readiness:
Training for any law enforcement agency is critical. Training for a fire of this magnitude is not what any officer would
imagine their training would be used for. MPD officers undergo annual training to keep their skills sharp and current,
as some of their skills may not be called upon on a regular basis.
Annual Recall Training is an annual mandatory requirement for sworn personnel. The training includes physical
training, wellness, firearms training and certification, arrest defense tactics, taser recertification and other training
exercises.
Officers are provided training by Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) about the dangers of fallen lines. A de-energized
line isn’t necessarily grounded; therefore, it is still considered dangerous. Officers will await electrical crews to arrive
to the scene to determine when a line is safe. For example, when a line is on an occupied vehicle, occupants are
instructed to remain within and/or how to move to safety with specific instructions to avoid electrocution. An
example of what is taught regarding downed power line safety is demonstrated in Appendix “A”.
